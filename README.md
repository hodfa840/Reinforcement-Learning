# Reinforcement-Learning

## Gridworld – The fastest way

In a world consisting of a grid, the task is to teach a small robot different behaviours using reinforcement
learning. The different squares represent states that naturally correspond to the position of the robot. Given
a certain state, the robot can choose to move left, right, up or down. The robot’s objective is to make its
way as efficiently as possible from a arbitrary starting point to a given goal, i.e. find the goal and try to
maximize the sum of the feedback under-way. It can choose to explore new parts of the world, or pursue
old accustomed patterns.
